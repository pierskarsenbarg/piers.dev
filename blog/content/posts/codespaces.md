One thing I wanted to do when I restarted this blog was to set up [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) so that I could write posts from my iPad as well as from my laptop. It was pretty easy to do. Admittedly my container is pretty simple, just installing hugo and git (I've got my theme in a submodule so I need git to checkout that) and my devcontainer.json is pretty empty as well. Annoyingly it's not easy to type on here with the on-screen keyboard, plus I can't type a backtick so I can't do code syntax either. I'll probably update this post later with the code from the container I'm running with the devcontainer.json.

All in all, not a bad expeiment though. I'm hoping I can use it as a way to write Pulumi programs and run them from here. I'll write a further post on that at some point.
