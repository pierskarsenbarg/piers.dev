I've seen many people talk about writing posts to help them learn, but it's not something I've ever really done. Usually because I'm worried about the fact that someone has already written about it, or that no one will find it interesting.

A tweet by [Angie Jones](https://twitter.com/techgirl1908) resonated with me recently:

It's true that not everyone learns the same way. I for one like seeing step by step guides on how to do things, whereas some prefer very technical documents and some prefer to watch videos.

In my role at [Pulumi](https://pulumi.com), I do find that I'm doing a lot of learning that isn't documented, and doesn't necessarily warant a blog post on the [company blog](https://pulumi.com/blog). However, that doesn't mean that I can't write them up separately. So this is me saying that I'm going to try to start writing upmy findings, especially on more complicated systems. Let's see how it goes.
